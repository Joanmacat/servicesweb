        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold md:text-3xl dark:text-white">Retiring in Andorra: A Haven for Tranquility and Financial Advantage</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">Beyond its allure for investors seeking to establish businesses due to its numerous benefits, Andorra also emerges as a tranquil and advantageous destination for retirement. Retiring in Andorra unveils a treasure trove of advantages, ranging from favorable economic conditions to an exceptional quality of life. You'll be assured of residing in a secure haven, nestled amidst the breathtaking natural splendor of the Pyrenees, an ideal setting for those who cherish direct contact with nature and an active, healthy lifestyle.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">To embark on your retirement journey in Andorra, you'll need to apply for a passive residence permit. Unlike other countries, Andorra doesn't offer a specific retirement visa. Passive residence is a permit granted to individuals who don't engage in professional activities within the country, making it the ideal option for retirees with passive income sources.</p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">Securing passive residency hinges on meeting the following criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">
            - <b>Minimum Investment of €600,000:</b> This investment can take the form of shares in Andorran companies, debt or financial instruments issued by local entities, life insurance products contracted with Andorran entities, or non-remunerated deposits at the Andorran Financial Authority (AFA). This amount can be reduced to €400,000 if the investment is made directly or indirectly and permanently and effectively to the Housing Fund, in accordance with applicable regulations.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">
            - <b>Demonstrating Annual Income:</b> You must showcase annual income exceeding 300% of the current annual minimum wage. An additional 100% of this indicator must be added for each dependent.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">
            - <b>Non-Remunerated Deposit:</b> A non-remunerated deposit of €47,500 at the AFA is required, which must be increased by €9,500 for each dependent. This deposit will be considered part of the minimum investment requirement.
        </li>
        <li class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">
            - <b>Minimum Stay:</b> You must spend a minimum of 90 days per year in the country.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">These requirements are updated according to the latest regulations, as of 2023.</p>

        <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">Andorra's tax system stands as a major draw for those seeking to optimize their savings and enjoy a comfortable retirement. Here, taxes are significantly lower compared to most European countries. The personal income tax (IRPF) boasts a highly competitive rate of 10% at most, while the general indirect tax (IGI), equivalent to VAT in other countries, is the lowest in Europe at 4.5%. Moreover, Andorra does not levy inheritance tax.</p>
        <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">These favorable tax conditions not only enable retirees to retain the majority of their savings but also facilitate a more relaxed lifestyle, free from financial worries. Andorra emerges as the ideal destination for those seeking to maximize their wealth during retirement. By choosing Andorra, you're not just selecting a tranquil and secure haven to relish this new chapter of your life; you're also positioning yourself in a place where your money goes further, allowing you to make the most of your retirement years.</p>
