        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">Until now, the regulation of transport between Spain and Andorra was governed by a bilateral agreement signed in 2015, which required a specific authorization to carry out the transport of goods between the two countries.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">The Kingdom of Spain and the Principality of Andorra signed this International Agreement on international road transport between the two countries, regulating the services carried out by Spanish transporters with origin or destination in that country or in transit through its territory, as well as Andorran transporters in our country.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold dark:text-white">A new agreement</h3>
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">According to this agreement, to carry out any transport service, it was necessary to previously request a bilateral authorization in the country where the vehicle was registered, so Spanish transporters had to request it from the Ministry of Transport.</p>
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">However, this bilateral agreement is coming to an end, as the transport association Fenadismer has learned that the European Commission is processing the upcoming signing of an Association Agreement between the European Union, Andorra, and San Marino, which must be ratified by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">This will allow both countries to participate in the EUâ€™s internal market, similar to Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein under the European Economic Area Agreement.</p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">Once the new agreement comes into force, expected at the beginning of next year, transport originating from or destined for Andorra, as well as transits, can be carried out under the community license, without any type of restriction or quota.</p>
